Summary
This C program utilizes the GTK+ library to create and display a simple graphical window titled "Brickout Tutorial". It initializes
the GTK environment, creates a top-level window, configures its title, position, size, and type hint, and sets up a callback
to gracefully exit the program when the window is closed.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Include the GTK Header:


The code starts by including the GTK header file (#include &lt;gtk/gtk.h>) which provides the necessary functions and definitions for GTK operations.

Main Function:


The main function serves as the entry point for the program, where command-line arguments (argc and argv) are used by the GTK initialization function.

Initialize GTK:


gtk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
This function initializes the GTK library and parses any command-line arguments intended for GTK. It prepares the environment necessary 
for creating and managing the graphical user interface.


Create a New Window:


window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
A new top-level window is created. A top-level window is a primary window that acts as the main container for the applicationâ€™s widgets.


Set Window Title:


gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), &quot;Brickout Tutorial&quot;);
This function sets the title of the window to "Brickout Tutorial". The title is typically displayed in the title bar of the window.


Set Window Position:


gtk_window_set_position(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER);
This command positions the window in the center of the screen when it appears.


Set Default Window Size:


gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 640, 480);
It sets the initial size of the window to 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height.


Set Window Type Hint:


gtk_window_set_type_hint(GTK_WINDOW(window), GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_UTILITY);
The type hint informs the window manager that the window is a utility window, which may have different behavior or appearance 
compared to standard application windows.


Connect the Destroy Signal:


g_signal_connect(window, &quot;destroy&quot;, G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);
This connects the "destroy" signal to the gtk_main_quit function. When the window is closed (destroyed), the GTK main loop 
is instructed to exit, ensuring a graceful termination of the application.


Display the Window:


gtk_widget_show_all(window);
This function makes the window and all of its child widgets visible. It is essential to call this function after setting up 
the window, so the user can see the graphical interface.


Enter the GTK Main Loop:


gtk_main();
This function enters the GTK main loop, which is an event-driven loop that waits for events (like key presses, 
mouse clicks, etc.) and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers. The program remains in this loop until 
a termination signal (like closing the window) is received.


Return from Main:


return 0;
Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.


This step-by-step breakdown explains how the program establishes a basic GTK window and handles 
window events for a simple graphical application.
